	I take great pride in my work and approach every project with care, precision,

    in your space — not just with a fresh coat of paint, but with attention to detail
    and a commitment to quality that shows in every brushstroke.
 
    The section below outlines my working method, giving you a clear picture
    of how I work and what you can expect throughout the process.

					<p><span style="color: yellow; font-size: 1.8em;"><b><u>Preparation</u></b></span><br><br>
				    Proper preparation is the foundation of a high-quality, professional paint job. No matter how skilled a painter is or how premium the paint may be, the final result will only be as good as the surface it is applied to. Without thorough preparation, even the best materials can’t achieve a flawless finish.</p>

This ensures the spray finish is as flawless as possible. Using the Mirka Abranet sanding system, dust is significantly reduced, with 99% of it being captured by the dust extractor. All surfaces are machine sanded to provide a smooth and even base before the paint application</p>

				<p><span style="color: yellow; font-size: 1.8em;"><b><u>Airless Spraying</u></b></span><br><br>Airless spraying uses high pressure to atomize the paint into fine particles, which are then evenly applied to the surface. This technique creates a smooth, flawless finish with excellent coverage, making it ideal for larger surfaces like walls and ceilings. The high pressure ensures the paint is applied quickly and efficiently, resulting in a superior finish.</p>

				HVLP is a low-pressure system that uses a turbine to atomize the paint into a fine mist. This results in a smooth, even finish with minimal overspray, making it ideal for detailed work. It's especially suitable for furniture, cabinets, and smaller items, where a high-quality, flawless finish is required. The system provides excellent control, ensuring precision and a professional result every time.</p>
